This project was a heavy use of JavaScript code to enable the user through choices create a password 8 to 128 characters long. This included lowercase, uppercase, numerical and special symbols. 
The user through several window prompts is asked several questions to ascertain what type of password they would like to create. This series of questions includes length type and statements of yes or no to see if the user would like to use lowercase, uppercase, numerical and or special characters. The user must make at least one choice otherwise they are prompted to start over again.
The actions are started when the user clicks the GENERATE PASSWORD button.
